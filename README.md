# blackhole-with-gravitational-lensing
This is a simple blackhole simulation with gravitational lensing for static bodies nearby, the controls are intuitive and done in pygame whereas the rendering is done in opengl
You will need a pygame CE pip installation, for which you can enter the following in your command terminal:
pip install pygame-ce

Secondly, you need PyOpenGL for which the pip installation is as follows
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

The controls for the various actions for the program are as follows:
Keys:
- ESC / Q : quit
- R       : reset camera
- G       : toggle grid
- L       : toggle lensing
- +/-     : change lens strength
- [/]     : change lens radius(the square brackets

Mouse:
- Left drag: orbit yaw/pitch
- Wheel: zoom

Im relatively new to this and am still learning renders and things. This is very basic and probably has a lot of inaccuracies so any help with this will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
